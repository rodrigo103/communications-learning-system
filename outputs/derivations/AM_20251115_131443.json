      "description": "We start with the basic definition of modulation: multiplying a carrier signal by a message signal.",
      "equation": "s_{AM}(t) = A_c [1 + m(t)] \\cos(2\\pi f_c t)",
      "explanation": "Where A_c is carrier amplitude, m(t) is the normalized message signal, and f_c is the carrier frequency."

      "explanation": "This separates the carrier component from the modulated component."

      "explanation": "The first term is the unmodulated carrier. The second term creates upper and lower sidebands."

      "explanation": "The carrier appears as impulses at ±f_c, and the message spectrum M(f) is translated to ±f_c."
