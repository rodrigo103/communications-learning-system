## 1. Starting Definitions

### 1.1 Message Signal (Baseband)
The information-bearing signal we want to transmit:

$$m(t) = A_m \cos(2\pi f_m t)$$

**Where:**
- $m(t)$ = message signal (the information)
- $A_m$ = amplitude of message signal [V]
- $f_m$ = message frequency [Hz] (typically audio range: 20 Hz - 20 kHz)

**Physical Meaning:** This is the low-frequency signal containing our information (voice, music, data) that cannot propagate efficiently through space on its own.

### 1.2 Carrier Signal (High-Frequency)
The high-frequency wave that will "carry" our message:

$$c(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t)$$

**Where:**
- $c(t)$ = carrier signal
- $A_c$ = carrier amplitude [V]
- $f_c$ = carrier frequency [Hz] (typically kHz to GHz range)
- **Condition:** $f_c \gg f_m$ (carrier frequency much greater than message frequency)

**Physical Meaning:** This high-frequency sinusoid can propagate efficiently as an electromagnetic wave through air/space.

## 2. Step-by-Step Derivation

### Step 1: Amplitude Modulation Principle

The fundamental concept of AM is to **vary the carrier's amplitude** in proportion to the message signal.

Instead of constant amplitude $A_c$, we create a time-varying amplitude:

$$A(t) = A_c + k_a m(t)$$

**Where:** $k_a$ = amplitude sensitivity constant [dimensionless]

**Why this step?** We're making the carrier amplitude track the message signal. When $m(t)$ is positive, amplitude increases; when negative, it decreases.

---

### Step 2: Normalized Form (Modulation Index)

For convenience, we normalize the message signal and define the modulation index:

$$A(t) = A_c[1 + \mu m_n(t)]$$

**Where:**
- $\mu$ = modulation index = $\frac{k_a A_m}{A_c}$ (typically $\mu \leq 1$)
- $m_n(t) = \frac{m(t)}{A_m}$ = normalized message signal (peak value = 1)

**Why this step?** The modulation index $\mu$ gives us a dimensionless measure of "how much" we're modulating. Keeping $\mu \leq 1$ prevents over-modulation (distortion).

---

### Step 3: Form the Modulated Signal

The AM signal is created by multiplying the time-varying amplitude by the carrier:

$$s_{AM}(t) = A(t) \cdot \cos(2\pi f_c t)$$

$$s_{AM}(t) = A_c[1 + \mu \cos(2\pi f_m t)] \cos(2\pi f_c t)$$

**Why this step?** This is the mathematical implementation of "varying the carrier amplitude." The multiplication creates the modulated waveform.

**Physical Interpretation:** At time $t$:
- When $\cos(2\pi f_m t) = +1$ (peak): amplitude = $A_c(1 + \mu)$
- When $\cos(2\pi f_m t) = -1$ (trough): amplitude = $A_c(1 - \mu)$
- When $\cos(2\pi f_m t) = 0$ (zero-crossing): amplitude = $A_c$

---

### Step 4: Expand Using Distributive Property

$$s_{AM}(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t) + A_c \mu \cos(2\pi f_m t) \cos(2\pi f_c t)$$

**Why this step?** We separate the carrier component from the modulation component to analyze them independently.

**Components:**
- **First term:** Unmodulated carrier (always present)
- **Second term:** Product of message and carrier (the actual modulation)

---

### Step 5: Apply Trigonometric Product-to-Sum Identity

Use the identity: $\cos A \cos B = \frac{1}{2}[\cos(A-B) + \cos(A+B)]$

For the second term where $A = 2\pi f_m t$ and $B = 2\pi f_c t$:

$$\cos(2\pi f_m t) \cos(2\pi f_c t) = \frac{1}{2}[\cos(2\pi(f_c - f_m)t) + \cos(2\pi(f_c + f_m)t)]$$

**Why this step?** This reveals the **frequency translation** property—modulation shifts the baseband spectrum up to the carrier frequency, creating sidebands.

---

### Step 6: Final Expanded Form

Substituting back:

$$s_{AM}(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t) + \frac{A_c \mu}{2} \cos(2\pi(f_c - f_m)t) + \frac{A_c \mu}{2} \cos(2\pi(f_c + f_m)t)$$

**Three frequency components:**
1. **Carrier:** frequency $f_c$, amplitude $A_c$
2. **Lower Sideband (LSB):** frequency $f_c - f_m$, amplitude $\frac{A_c \mu}{2}$
3. **Upper Sideband (USB):** frequency $f_c + f_m$, amplitude $\frac{A_c \mu}{2}$

---

## 3. Final Formulas

### Compact Form:
$$\boxed{s_{AM}(t) = A_c[1 + \mu \cos(2\pi f_m t)] \cos(2\pi f_c t)}$$

### Expanded Form (Frequency Components):
$$\boxed{s_{AM}(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t) + \frac{A_c \mu}{2} \cos(2\pi(f_c - f_m)t) + \frac{A_c \mu}{2} \cos(2\pi(f_c + f_m)t)}$$

## 4. Key Results

### Bandwidth
$$\boxed{BW_{AM} = 2f_m}$$

AM requires **twice the message bandwidth** because both sidebands are transmitted.

### Power Distribution

**Carrier Power:**
$$P_c = \frac{A_c^2}{2R}$$

**Sideband Power (each):**
$$P_{SB} = \frac{(A_c \mu / 2)^2}{2R} = \frac{A_c^2 \mu^2}{8R}$$

**Total Power:**
$$P_{total} = P_c + 2P_{SB} = \frac{A_c^2}{2R}\left(1 + \frac{\mu^2}{2}\right)$$

### Efficiency

Only the sidebands carry information:

$$\eta = \frac{P_{sidebands}}{P_{total}} = \frac{\mu^2/2}{1 + \mu^2/2} = \frac{\mu^2}{2 + \mu^2}$$

**Maximum efficiency** (when $\mu = 1$):
$$\boxed{\eta_{max} = \frac{1}{3} = 33.33\%}$$

This poor efficiency is AM's major weakness!

## 5. Physical Interpretation

### Time Domain
The AM signal is an envelope that follows the message signal, modulating around the carrier frequency. The envelope's shape is: $A_c[1 + \mu m_n(t)]$

### Frequency Domain
- **Original message:** spectrum centered at 0 Hz (baseband)
- **AM signal:** spectrum shifted to $f_c$ with:
  - Carrier spike at $f_c$
  - LSB: $f_c - f_m$ to $f_c$
  - USB: $f_c$ to $f_c + f_m$

### Why Both Sidebands?
Both sidebands carry **identical information** (redundant). This motivated development of:
- **DSB-SC** (Double Sideband Suppressed Carrier) - removes carrier, saves power
- **SSB** (Single Sideband) - removes carrier + one sideband, saves power and bandwidth

## 6. Applications

**Where AM is used:**
- AM radio broadcasting (540-1600 kHz)
- Aviation communications
- Citizen's Band (CB) radio
- Amplitude modulation is also the basis for QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation)

**Advantages:**
- Simple, low-cost receivers (envelope detector)
- Well-established technology
- Good for broadcasting (one transmitter, many receivers)

**Disadvantages:**
- Poor power efficiency (67% wasted on carrier)
- Poor noise immunity (noise affects amplitude)
- Inefficient spectrum usage (redundant sidebands)

---

## 7. Important Design Considerations

**Modulation Index Constraint:**
$$\mu \leq 1$$

If $\mu > 1$: **over-modulation** occurs → envelope becomes negative → distortion after demodulation

**Demodulation:**
Simple envelope detector (diode + RC filter) can recover $m(t)$ because the information is in the amplitude variations.
