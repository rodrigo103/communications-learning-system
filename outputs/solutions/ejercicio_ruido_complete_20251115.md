## Solution Part (a): Noise Figure F

### What is being asked?
Calculate the noise figure F of the amplifier in both linear (dimensionless) and dB scales.

### Relevant Formulas

**Noise Figure (Linear):**

$$F = \frac{P_{n,out}}{G \cdot P_{n,in}}$$

Where:
- $P_{n,out}$ = output noise power
- $G$ = linear power gain
- $P_{n,in}$ = input noise power

**Noise Figure (dB):**

$$F_{dB} = 10 \log_{10}(F)$$

**Power Gain Conversion:**

$$G = 10^{G_{dB}/10}$$

**Input Noise Power:**

$$P_{n,in} = \eta_{in} \cdot BW$$

### Step 1: Convert gain from dB to linear

$$G = 10^{G_{dB}/10} = 10^{50/10} = 10^5$$

$$\boxed{G = 100,000 \text{ (linear)}}$$

### Step 2: Calculate input noise power

$$P_{n,in} = \eta_{in} \cdot BW$$

$$P_{n,in} = (12 \times 10^{-21} \text{ W/Hz}) \times (20 \times 10^3 \text{ Hz})$$

$$P_{n,in} = 12 \times 20 \times 10^{-21} \times 10^3$$

$$P_{n,in} = 240 \times 10^{-18} \text{ W}$$

$$\boxed{P_{n,in} = 2.4 \times 10^{-16} \text{ W}}$$

### Step 3: Calculate noise figure (linear)

$$F = \frac{P_{n,out}}{G \cdot P_{n,in}}$$

$$F = \frac{72 \times 10^{-12}}{10^5 \times 2.4 \times 10^{-16}}$$

$$F = \frac{72 \times 10^{-12}}{2.4 \times 10^{-11}}$$

$$F = \frac{72}{24} = 3$$

$$\boxed{F = 3 \text{ (linear)}}$$

### Step 4: Convert to dB

$$F_{dB} = 10 \log_{10}(3)$$

$$F_{dB} = 10 \times 0.4771$$

$$\boxed{F_{dB} = 4.77 \text{ dB}}$$

### Dimensional Validation

- $G$: dimensionless (power ratio) ✓
- $P_{n,in}$: [W/Hz] × [Hz] = [W] ✓
- $F$: [W] / ([dimensionless] × [W]) = dimensionless ✓
- $F_{dB}$: dB scale ✓

### Explanation

The noise figure of 3 (or 4.77 dB) indicates that the amplifier adds noise to the signal, degrading the SNR by a factor of 3. This is actually a good noise figure for an LNA (Low Noise Amplifier). Values close to 1 (0 dB) are ideal, meaning the amplifier adds minimal noise.

---

## Solution Part (b): Equivalent Noise Temperature Te

### What is being asked?
Calculate the equivalent noise temperature Te of the amplifier, which represents the additional noise added by the amplifier as an equivalent temperature.

### Relevant Formulas

**Noise Temperature Relationship:**

$$F = 1 + \frac{T_e}{T_0}$$

Therefore:

$$T_e = (F - 1) \cdot T_0$$

Where:
- $F$ = noise figure (linear)
- $T_e$ = equivalent noise temperature
- $T_0$ = reference temperature (290 K)

### Step 1: Apply the noise temperature formula

$$T_e = (F - 1) \cdot T_0$$

$$T_e = (3 - 1) \times 290 \text{ K}$$

$$T_e = 2 \times 290 \text{ K}$$

$$\boxed{T_e = 580 \text{ K}}$$

### Dimensional Validation

- $F - 1$: dimensionless ✓
- $T_0$: [K] ✓
- $T_e$: dimensionless × [K] = [K] ✓

### Explanation

The equivalent noise temperature of 580 K means that the amplifier adds as much noise as would be generated by a resistor at 580 K at its input. This is in addition to the thermal noise already present at the reference temperature of 290 K. The total effective noise temperature at the input would be 290 + 580 = 870 K.

---

## Solution Part (c): Total Noise Figure of Cascaded System

### What is being asked?
When two identical amplifiers are connected in cascade (series), calculate the total noise figure of the combined system.

### Relevant Formulas

**Friis Formula for Cascaded Systems:**

$$F_{total} = F_1 + \frac{F_2 - 1}{G_1}$$

For two identical amplifiers:
- $F_1 = F_2 = F = 3$
- $G_1 = G = 10^5$

**Total Noise Figure in dB:**

$$F_{total,dB} = 10 \log_{10}(F_{total})$$

### Step 1: Apply Friis formula

$$F_{total} = F_1 + \frac{F_2 - 1}{G_1}$$

$$F_{total} = 3 + \frac{3 - 1}{10^5}$$

$$F_{total} = 3 + \frac{2}{100,000}$$

$$F_{total} = 3 + 0.00002$$

$$\boxed{F_{total} = 3.00002 \text{ (linear)}}$$

### Step 2: Convert to dB

$$F_{total,dB} = 10 \log_{10}(3.00002)$$

$$F_{total,dB} = 10 \times 0.477134$$

$$\boxed{F_{total,dB} = 4.77 \text{ dB}}$$

### Dimensional Validation

- $F_1$: dimensionless ✓
- $(F_2 - 1)/G_1$: dimensionless/dimensionless = dimensionless ✓
- $F_{total}$: dimensionless ✓

### Explanation

The total noise figure (3.00002) is extremely close to the noise figure of the first amplifier alone (3). This demonstrates a key principle: **in cascaded amplifier systems, the first stage dominates the noise performance**. The high gain of the first amplifier (50 dB = 100,000) means that the noise contribution of the second stage is divided by 100,000, making it negligible. This is why LNAs are always placed first in receiver chains.

---

## Solution Part (d): Total Noise Temperature of Cascaded System

### What is being asked?
Calculate the total equivalent noise temperature of the two-amplifier cascade system.

### Relevant Formulas

**From Noise Figure:**

$$T_{total} = (F_{total} - 1) \cdot T_0$$

**Alternative (Cascade Formula for Temperature):**

$$T_{total} = T_{e1} + \frac{T_{e2}}{G_1}$$

Where:
- $T_{e1} = T_{e2} = T_e = 580$ K
- $G_1 = 10^5$

### Method 1: Using Total Noise Figure

$$T_{total} = (F_{total} - 1) \cdot T_0$$

$$T_{total} = (3.00002 - 1) \times 290 \text{ K}$$

$$T_{total} = 2.00002 \times 290 \text{ K}$$

$$\boxed{T_{total} = 580.006 \text{ K}}$$

### Method 2: Using Cascade Temperature Formula (Verification)

$$T_{total} = T_{e1} + \frac{T_{e2}}{G_1}$$

$$T_{total} = 580 + \frac{580}{10^5}$$

$$T_{total} = 580 + 0.0058$$

$$T_{total} = 580.0058 \text{ K}$$

Note: Small difference due to rounding in F_total calculation.

$$\boxed{T_{total} \approx 580 \text{ K}}$$

### Dimensional Validation

- $F_{total} - 1$: dimensionless ✓
- $T_0$: [K] ✓
- $T_{total}$: [K] ✓

### Explanation

The total noise temperature (580.006 K) is essentially equal to the noise temperature of the first amplifier alone (580 K). This confirms the same principle as in part (c): the second stage adds negligible noise (only 0.006 K) because its contribution is divided by the large gain of the first stage. The system noise temperature is dominated by the first amplifier.

## Solution Part (e): Output SNR

### What is being asked?
Calculate the signal-to-noise ratio at the output of the system when a signal of power $S_{in} = 10^{-15}$ W is applied at the input.

### Relevant Formulas

**SNR Relationship:**

$$SNR_{out} = \frac{SNR_{in}}{F}$$

**Input SNR:**

$$SNR_{in} = \frac{S_{in}}{P_{n,in}}$$

**Output SNR:**

$$SNR_{out} = \frac{S_{in}}{F \cdot P_{n,in}}$$

**Output SNR in dB:**

$$SNR_{out,dB} = 10 \log_{10}(SNR_{out})$$

### Step 1: Calculate input SNR

We already calculated $P_{n,in} = 2.4 \times 10^{-16}$ W in part (a).

$$SNR_{in} = \frac{S_{in}}{P_{n,in}}$$

$$SNR_{in} = \frac{10^{-15}}{2.4 \times 10^{-16}}$$

$$SNR_{in} = \frac{10}{2.4}$$

$$\boxed{SNR_{in} = 4.167 \text{ (linear)}}$$

### Step 2: Calculate output SNR (linear)

$$SNR_{out} = \frac{SNR_{in}}{F}$$

$$SNR_{out} = \frac{4.167}{3}$$

$$\boxed{SNR_{out} = 1.389 \text{ (linear)}}$$

### Step 3: Convert to dB

$$SNR_{out,dB} = 10 \log_{10}(1.389)$$

$$SNR_{out,dB} = 10 \times 0.1428$$

$$\boxed{SNR_{out,dB} = 1.43 \text{ dB}}$$

### Alternative Calculation (Verification)

$$SNR_{in,dB} = 10 \log_{10}(4.167) = 6.20 \text{ dB}$$

$$SNR_{out,dB} = SNR_{in,dB} - F_{dB}$$

$$SNR_{out,dB} = 6.20 - 4.77 = 1.43 \text{ dB}$$

✓ Verified!

### Dimensional Validation

- $SNR_{in}$: [W]/[W] = dimensionless ✓
- $SNR_{out}$: dimensionless/dimensionless = dimensionless ✓
- $SNR_{out,dB}$: dB scale ✓

### Explanation

The output SNR of 1.389 (or 1.43 dB) is significantly lower than the input SNR of 4.167 (6.20 dB). The amplifier has degraded the SNR by exactly the noise figure: 4.77 dB. This is the fundamental trade-off: while the amplifier increases signal power, it also adds noise, resulting in a lower SNR. An output SNR of 1.43 dB is quite low and would likely result in poor signal quality. In practice, you would want a much higher input signal power or a lower noise figure amplifier for acceptable performance.

## Validation Checks

### 1. Consistency Check: Noise Figure and Temperature

From F = 3 and Te = 580 K:

$$F = 1 + \frac{T_e}{T_0} = 1 + \frac{580}{290} = 1 + 2 = 3$$ ✓

### 2. Power Balance Check

Output noise power should equal:

$$P_{n,out} = G \cdot P_{n,in} \cdot F$$

$$P_{n,out} = 10^5 \times 2.4 \times 10^{-16} \times 3$$

$$P_{n,out} = 72 \times 10^{-12} \text{ W}$$ ✓ Matches given data!

### 3. SNR Degradation Check

$$\frac{SNR_{in}}{SNR_{out}} = \frac{4.167}{1.389} = 3 = F$$ ✓

This confirms the fundamental relationship: amplifier degrades SNR by exactly F.

### 4. Cascade Contribution Check

Second stage contribution:

$$\Delta F = \frac{F_2 - 1}{G_1} = \frac{2}{10^5} = 0.00002$$

This is only 0.0007% of the first stage contribution! ✓

### 5. Thermal Noise Verification

Theoretical thermal noise power:

$$P_{thermal} = k \cdot T_0 \cdot BW$$

$$P_{thermal} = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \times 290 \times 20 \times 10^3$$

$$P_{thermal} = 8.004 \times 10^{-17} \text{ W}$$

Given input noise:

$$P_{n,in} = 2.4 \times 10^{-16} \text{ W} = 3 \times P_{thermal}$$

This suggests the input noise includes both thermal noise and additional source noise. ✓

## Key Learnings and Physical Interpretation

### 1. Noise Figure Interpretation
- **F = 3 (4.77 dB)** is considered a good noise figure for an LNA
- It means the amplifier degrades the SNR by a factor of 3
- Perfect amplifier would have F = 1 (0 dB)

### 2. Equivalent Noise Temperature
- **Te = 580 K** represents the additional noise as equivalent temperature
- Total effective temperature: T₀ + Te = 290 + 580 = 870 K
- This is the temperature of a resistor that would produce the same noise

### 3. First Stage Dominance (Critical Principle)
- In cascade, second stage adds only 0.00002 to noise figure
- **High gain in first stage (50 dB) makes subsequent stages irrelevant**
- This is why LNAs are always first in receiver chains
- Friis formula shows contribution decreases by 1/G for each stage

### 4. SNR Degradation
- Input SNR: 6.20 dB → Output SNR: 1.43 dB
- Loss: exactly 4.77 dB (the noise figure)
- No matter how much gain, SNR always degrades by F
- **Amplifiers boost signal AND noise by same factor, but add extra noise**

### 5. Practical Implications
- Output SNR of 1.43 dB is very low (barely above noise floor)
- Would need higher input signal or better amplifier for good reception
- Bandwidth choice affects noise power (P_n ∝ BW)
- Temperature control can improve noise performance

### 6. Design Guidelines
- Minimize noise figure of first stage (use LNA)
- Maximize gain of first stage (reduces impact of later stages)
- Consider total system from antenna to detector
- Cryogenic cooling can reduce thermal noise (lower T₀)

### 7. Mathematical Relationships Summary

$$F = 1 + \frac{T_e}{T_0} \quad \text{(Noise figure ↔ Temperature)}$$

$$F_{cascade} = F_1 + \frac{F_2 - 1}{G_1} + \frac{F_3 - 1}{G_1 G_2} + \ldots \quad \text{(Friis)}$$

$$SNR_{out} = \frac{SNR_{in}}{F} \quad \text{(SNR degradation)}$$

$$P_n = k \cdot T \cdot BW \quad \text{(Thermal noise)}$$

## Conclusion

This exercise demonstrates the fundamental principles of noise analysis in amplifier systems:

1. **Noise quantification**: Using both noise figure (F) and temperature (Te) representations
2. **System analysis**: Applying Friis formula to understand cascade effects
3. **Performance prediction**: Calculating output SNR from system parameters
4. **Engineering insight**: First stage dominates noise in high-gain systems

The results show that a well-designed LNA with 50 dB gain and F = 4.77 dB effectively isolates the signal from subsequent stage noise, but still degrades the SNR according to its noise figure. The extremely low output SNR (1.43 dB) indicates this system would need a stronger input signal for practical communication.
