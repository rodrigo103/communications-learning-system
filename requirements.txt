# Minimal dependencies for subagent-first architecture
# Most work is done by Claude Code subagents, not Python code

# CLI interface
click>=8.1.0

# Date/time utilities (used by SessionCoordinator)
python-dateutil>=2.8.0

# Testing (optional)
pytest>=7.4.0

# Note: The following are NOT needed anymore because work is done by subagents:
# - numpy, scipy, sympy: Math libraries (subagents handle derivations)
# - matplotlib, seaborn: Plotting (subagents generate visualizations)
# - genanki: Anki card generation (can be added later if needed)
# - reportlab: PDF generation (subagents create Markdown, can convert to PDF externally)
# - graphviz, networkx: Concept mapping (future feature)
