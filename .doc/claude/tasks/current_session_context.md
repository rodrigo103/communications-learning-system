# Current Session Context

**Date**: 2025-12-09
**Activity**: Emergency Progress Assessment - 9 Days to Exam
**Critical Question**: Can the student pass the exam?

## Exam Context
- **Exam Date**: 2025-12-18 (18 de diciembre)
- **Days Remaining**: 9 days
- **Critical Constraint**: Cannot study every day

## Student Request
Student is asking for honest assessment of whether they can pass the Communications Systems exam given:
1. Current progress level
2. Time remaining (9 days)
3. Inability to study every single day

## Analysis Needed
1. Current progress vs. required progress
2. Critical topics covered vs. missing
3. Realistic study plan for 9 days (with rest days)
4. Honest probability assessment
5. Emergency triage strategy

## Context for Analysis
- Last state update: November 15, 2025 (24+ days ago!)
- State file shows 0% progress (likely not updated)
- BUT: Context file shows significant work on FM (Unit 4) and Noise (Unit 7)
- Session history shows minimal activity tracking
- Need to infer actual progress from outputs/ directory

## Work Identified So Far

### Derivations Completed (9 files):
1. AM modulation (3 versions)
2. FM Carson's Rule
3. FM Narrowband
4. Friis Cascade (2 versions)
5. QAM comprehensive
6. Shannon-Hartley comprehensive
7. Parseval's theorem

### Solutions Completed (2 files):
1. Exercise TP5_3 (FM receiver SNR) - CORRECTED version
2. Noise problem (complete)

### Recent Work (from context file):
- **Unit 4 (FM)**: Deep understanding, corrected major formula error
- **Unit 7 (Noise)**: Good understanding of noise figure, Friis formula
- **Unit 9 (Information Theory)**: Has Shannon-Hartley derivation

## Critical Finding
The learning_state.json shows 0% progress but this is CLEARLY WRONG - it hasn't been updated since Nov 15. The actual work shows significant progress in critical areas.

## Next Steps for Analysis
1. Manually assess actual progress from outputs
2. Map completed work to unit structure
3. Calculate realistic completion percentage
4. Identify critical gaps
5. Create emergency 9-day plan
6. Provide honest pass/fail assessment

## Priority Topics (from course structure)
**CRITICAL (Must Know):**
- Unit 3: Modulación Lineal (AM, DSB, SSB)
- Unit 4: Modulación Exponencial (FM, Carson)
- Unit 7: Ruido (Noise figure, Friis, SNR)
- Unit 9: Teoría de la Información (Shannon-Hartley)

**IMPORTANT (Should Know):**
- Unit 2: Análisis de Señales (Fourier, Parseval)
- Unit 6: Modulación Digital (QAM, PSK)
- Unit 8: Intercomparación (System comparisons)

**LOWER PRIORITY:**
- Unit 1: Introducción
- Unit 5: Modulación de Pulsos
- Unit 10: Temas Avanzados

## Assessment Framework
With 9 days and inability to study daily, realistic study time:
- Assume 5-6 effective study days
- Need ~4-6 hours per day for concentrated work
- Total available: ~25-35 hours of study time

For 87 concepts:
- Already covered: ~15-20 concepts (estimated from outputs)
- Remaining: ~67-72 concepts
- Need: ~2-3 concepts per hour (aggressive pace)
- Realistic for critical units only: ~35-40 concepts possible

**Conclusion Setup**: Will need to determine if covering critical 35-40 concepts in critical units is enough to pass.
