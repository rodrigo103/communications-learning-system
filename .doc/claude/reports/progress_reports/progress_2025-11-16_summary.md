# Progress Summary

**Date**: 2025-11-16
**Days to Exam**: 29

## Quick Stats
- Overall: 7% (actual) vs 0% (tracked)
- Concepts: 7/87 mastered
- Problems: 1/150 solved
- Status: SEVERELY BEHIND SCHEDULE

## Top 3 Priorities
1. FIX TRACKING SYSTEM - Update learning_state.json TODAY
2. Shannon-Hartley derivation (Unit 9) - CRITICAL gap
3. Problem-solving practice - Need 3-5 problems DAILY

## This Week Goal
Complete 13 concepts + 20 problems by Nov 23
- Unit 7 (Noise): Finish remaining concepts
- Unit 9 (Information Theory): Shannon-Hartley, entropy
- Unit 3 (Linear Mod): DSB, SSB

## Critical Issues
1. Tracking system broken - work not recorded
2. Only 1 active study day in last week
3. Problem practice severely neglected (1/150)
4. 29 days = need 3 concepts + 5 problems PER DAY

## Honest Assessment
**Current trajectory: FAIL**
- Need 5-7 hours daily study for 29 consecutive days
- Must prioritize problem-solving (60% of time)
- Skip Units 1, 5, 10 if needed (triage approach)

## Realistic Path to Pass
- Week 1: 20 concepts, 30 problems
- Week 2-3: 40 concepts, 70 problems  
- Week 4: 15 concepts, 50 problems
- Result: 75 concepts (86%), 150 problems = LIKELY PASS

## Action Required NOW
Start 5-hour study session today. No exceptions.
