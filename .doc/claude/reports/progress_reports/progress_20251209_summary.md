# Progress Summary - CRITICAL ASSESSMENT

**Date**: 2025-12-09
**Days to Exam**: 9 días (exam: 2025-12-18)

## Quick Stats
- Overall: ~23% (sistema muestra 0% pero está desactualizado)
- Concepts: ~20/87 dominados
- Problems: 2-3/150 resueltos
- Status: ATRASADO pero RECUPERABLE

## Can You Pass? YES - with conditions

**Probability:** 65-75% (with disciplined execution)

**Requirements:**
1. 6 effective study days
2. 5-6 hours/day concentrated work
3. Focus ONLY on critical units (3,4,7,8,9)
4. Solve 20-25 additional problems
5. Accept you won't cover all 10 units

## Current Strengths
- Unit 4 (FM): 60% - solid foundation
- Unit 7 (Noise): 50% - good understanding
- Unit 9 (Shannon): 30% - theory understood
- Physical intuition: catching errors (good sign)

## Critical Gaps
- Unit 8 (Intercomparación): 0% - MUST COMPLETE
- Unit 3 (AM): Missing DSB, SSB, VSB
- Unit 6 (Digital): Missing PSK, BER
- Problem-solving speed: need practice

## Top 3 Priorities

1. **Complete Unit 8** (Intercomparación de Sistemas)
   - Zero progress, high exam weight
   - SNR comparisons: AM vs FM vs DSB vs Digital
   - Time needed: 6 hours

2. **Finish Unit 3** (DSB, SSB, VSB)
   - Currently 40% (only AM covered)
   - Critical for modulation comparisons
   - Time needed: 5 hours

3. **Intensive Problem Practice** (20-25 problems)
   - Currently only 2-3 solved
   - Need speed and automaticity
   - Time needed: 15-20 hours

## This Week Goal

**Emergency Plan (6 effective days):**
- Day 1: Complete Unit 3 (DSB/SSB) + 4 problems
- Day 2: Strengthen FM + Start Unit 8
- Day 3: Complete Unit 7 (cascaded noise)
- Day 4: Shannon-Hartley numerical problems
- Day 5: Unit 6 (PSK, BER) + Unit 8 finish
- Day 6: Mock exam + review

**Total study time needed:** 30-36 hours

## Honest Assessment

**What you CANNOT do:**
- Cover all 10 units completely
- Master all 87 concepts
- Study without a focused plan

**What you CAN do:**
- Master 25 critical concepts (feasible)
- Solve 20-25 key problems (feasible)
- Pass with 65-75% grade (realistic)

**Your biggest risk:** Trying to cover everything and mastering nothing

**Your biggest opportunity:** You already have solid foundations in critical areas (FM, Noise, Shannon)

## Immediate Action (Next 2 hours)

```
/derive DSB-SC modulation
/derive SSB modulation (filter and phasing methods)
[Solve 2 AM/DSB problems]
```

## Message

It's hard but DOABLE. You have 9 days and real chance to pass. The plan is realistic if you execute disciplinarily. Don't panic - execute.

Start NOW with Unit 3. Every hour counts.

**Good luck!** 🎓
